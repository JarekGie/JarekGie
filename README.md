About me
I began my adventure in the world of IT, in 2006. I started with ERP system implementations and website development.

The period from 2007 to 2019 was the time of providing IT outsourcing for small businesses.

During this time, I provided complex services to small businesses. Among the services I provided were:
- design and installation of local networks
- configuring network devices (routers, switches, next generation firewalls
- implementation and management of windows server
- user identity management
- solving current user problems.

In 2019, I started working at Atos Poland Global Services in the BDS department, in the position of Security Engineer in the IAM team.

Since 2020, I have been working with Makolab S.A. as DevOps/Support Engineer. There I am responsible for, among other things:
- monitoring application performance.
- resolving incidents from the L2/L3 level
- close cooperation with development and QA teams in devops methodology
- monitoring the Kubernetes cluster
- application deployments using Jenkins

Among the most interesting projects, I can count the preparation and implementation of AWS environment using CloudFormation, Terraform, Ansible and Jenkins.
